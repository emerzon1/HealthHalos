                    <br />What are Health Halos?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As defined by the Macmillan dictionary, a health halo is
                    “the perception that a particular food is good for you even
                    when there is little or no evidence to confirm this is
                    true.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Health halos make unhealthy foods seem healthier, and get
                    people to eat more of their food and spend more money. For
                    example, fast food restaurants like McDonalds put salads on
                    their menu in order to make their food seem healthier.  
                </p>
                <h3 style="color: darkblue">
                    <br />What is the effect of health halos?
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Subway advertises its food as being fresh. Their motto is
                    even "eat fresh."
                    <img
                        style="
                            position: relative;
                            left: 20%;
                            bottom: 25px;
                            width: 20%;
                        "
                        src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Subway_Eat_Fresh_Logo.svg/1200px-Subway_Eat_Fresh_Logo.svg.png"
                        alt="Subway Logo"
                    /><br />This is done in order to create a health halo around
                    their food. The effect of this health halo is that people
                    believe that Subway's food is much healthier than it
                    actually is. An article from <em>The Guardian</em> describes
                    a study that showed that people eating at Subway
                    underestimated the amount of calories in their food "by an
                    average of 151 calories," much more than people eating at
                    McDonalds (Peloza and Montford 2).

                <h3 style="color: darkblue">
                    <br />How do companies create health halos?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  There are many ways that fast food restaurants trick consumers.  Here are some of them:
                  <h4>
                    <strong><br/>All Natural</strong>
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    When restaurants call their food all natural, it doesn't mean anything.  "All natural" is extremely misleading and has no concrete definition.  
                    Many people believe that all natural food is healthier, but in reality it doesn't make a difference.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    <strong><br/>No Added Hormones</strong>
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    It is illegal in the United States to give poultry hormones.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    <strong><br/>Fresh and Artisan</strong>
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    When foods are called fresh or artisan, people believe they are healthier.  They aren't necessarily.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    <strong><br/>Crispy</strong>
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    The word "fried" has a very bad connotation in the United States, so fast food restaurants call their fried food "crispy."
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    <strong><br/>Plant-based</strong>
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Many fast food restaurants have been making extremely processed plant-based 
                    burgers and then giving customers the impression that these burgers are healthy.  
                    However, many of these are just as unhealthy as the real burger, even though they are vegetarian.  
                    <strong>Not every plant-based burger is healthier than a regular burger.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    <strong><br/>Colors</strong>
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Many fast food restaurants use colors to influence customers.
                    <ol>
                      <li><strong>Yellow: </strong>According to an article by Insider, "Yellow has long been associated with feelings of 
                        contentment, happiness, competence, and comfort" (Uley 1).  </li>
                      <li><strong>Red: </strong>Red establishes desire and triggers hunger.</li>
                      <li><strong>Green: </strong>Fast food restaurants use the color green because green is associated with health.  Subway is one of those restaurants.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      An example of a company that uses colors is McDonalds.  McDonalds uses red and yellow in their logo so that
                      people feel a sense of happiness when they see the yellow arches and want to eat at the restaurant.  The pairing of
                      red and yellow is known as the "Ketchup and Mustard Theory" and influences people to stop to get food (Uley 2).
                      Red and yellow is the most common pairing of colors in fast food logos.
                    </p>
                  </p>
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: darkblue; text-align: center; margin: 0">
                  <br />How are people affected by health halos in fast food?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The health halo effect makes people comfortable with eating more food because they feel less guilty eating foods 
                  they believe are healthier than they actually are.  Health halos are very misleading and make people less aware
                  of how many calories are in food.  According to an article published by Oxford Academic, when fast food restaurants 
                  claim to be healthy, people are more likely to underestimate the amount of calories in their food.  This then causes
                  them to choose sides, drinks, or desserts with a large amount of calories (Chandon and Wansink 1).  Health halos make
                  it much more difficult for people to eat healthily because they are so deceptive.
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: darkblue; text-align: center; margin: 0">
                  <br />How can people cause a change?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  It is very important to be aware of health halos and not let them affect you.  People should become familiar with
                  the methods that fast food restauranats use to trick consumers.  In addition, people should create social media accounts
                  in which they expose health halos in fast food.  For example, they could take a picture of Wendy's apple pecan salad and write
                  that it has more calories than a Big Mac.  These things could help immunize people to health halos in fast food and allow 
                  them to make healthy and informed decisions about their eating.
